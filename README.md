## Question 1: 
### Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
What metric would you report for this dataset?
What is its value?

## Answer:

Solely looking at the AOV can be misleading as it will only give you a partial picture of the customers purchase behavior. The AOV can be a helpful metric as it determines the mean of the data, however, it is crucial to also consider the median (the middle value of all orders) and the mode (the most frequently occuring order value) of the data to be able to formulate insights.

The problem with this metric is that it takes the average order amount and divides it by the amount of rows in the dataframe. This will cause outliers for transactions that contain more items, thus skewing the initial analysis report. This metric does not consider how many items were purchased in each transaction. To resolve this problem we need to sum all order amounts and divide by the quantity of items in the order. In this way, we are calculating the average price of sneakers selling by Shopify's partners.
